# Toggle Demo

This is a lightweight example showing how Firebase authentication and a realtime toggle could work together. The toggle state is stored in Firestore and mirrored to your project's Realtime Database.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the static server
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then open `index.html` in your browser.
