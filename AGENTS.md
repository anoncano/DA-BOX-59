# Contributor Guidelines

- Run `npm test --silent` before committing.
- Keep changes self-contained.
- The app is a Firebase-based demo with pages `index.html`, `register.html`, `admin.html`, and `general.html`.
- Styles rely on Tailwind. Keep HTML tidy and minimal.
- Avoid breaking the existing login and admin flows.
- Use the toast notification helper (`showNotif`) instead of browser alerts.
- Update documentation when changing behavior or adding files.
