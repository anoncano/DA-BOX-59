# Everyday User Guide 

## 🔓 Main Control Panel
There's a big switch. It turns something on or off (locked or unlocked).

It always shows the correct status. You don’t need to refresh the page.

## 🛠️ Report a Problem
Tap **"Report Issue"** to tell us if something’s broken or wrong.

Only admins see these reports — you won’t get replies.

## 🔐 Logging In
Forgot your password? Click **"Reset Password"**. It’ll email you a link.

Check your spam/junk folder if you don’t see the email.

You can press **Enter** after typing your password to log in faster.

## 👥 Inviting Others
If you’re allowed, use **"Invite Users"** to bring someone else in.

## 📲 The Device (ESP32)
The hardware reacts when you use the switches.

One switch controls the main thing.

If you have extra access, a second switch controls something else.

It automatically turns things off after a short time.

## 📡 If Wi-Fi Goes Down
The box makes its own Wi-Fi called `da-box-59`.

Connect to that and go to:  
**http://192.168.4.1**

Enter your PIN (we’ll give it to you).

Or just click the special link we give you — it opens everything for you.

## 💚 Heartbeat Light
There’s a faint heart shape behind the switch:

- **Green** = the device is working.
- **Red** = it stopped talking to the system.

## 🧪 Extra Access (Med Role)
If you have special access, you’ll see a second switch.

It works the same as the main one.

## 🗑️ Delete Your Account
Go to your **settings panel**.

Hit **"Delete Account"**, confirm it, and your info is gone forever.

## 💡 Offline Help
If the system is offline, it’ll show you steps to get in.

It gives you your PIN and a link — just tap **Copy** and follow the instructions.
